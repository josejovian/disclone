# Chat Group App

* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* This is my attempt on the [Chat Group Challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/UgCqszKR7Q7oqb4kRfI0). 
* The app has implemented all of the **mandatory** User Stories.
* The styling is mostly done with Chakra UI.
* I have also implemented basic responsiveness.
* I used Firebase to store the chats, channels, etc.
